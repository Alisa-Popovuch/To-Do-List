  <p>"Hmm, I see, it's just a regular scheduler and I'm not interested in it" , - you might think after reading the name of my app. But remember how many times you forgot about important things? For example, about a scheduled date or about not taking out the trash this morning?</p>
  <p>Therefore, I suggest you take a closer look at the application "To Do List". With its help, your brain will be able to unload and rest a little.</p>
  <p>When creating the application "To Do List", I used class components React.</p>
  <p>In the future I would like to add to the application:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>so that when you reload the page, your tasks are saved;</li>
    <li>time column and reminder about approaching task deadline.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Since I created the project when I was studying React and class components in particular, my application can of course be used for educational purposes.</p>
